# JavaScript

directory and type `npm install`. This will install all the
dependencies of the project. After that you can build the project
with: `npm run front_end`

# Powered by:

This is using `WebSockets`, `nodejs`, `React`.

# Developing

After cloning the repo you need to run `npm install`. During
development you can just use the webpack live reloading dev server,
run it with `npm run dev-server`. This will reload the React code for
you, once ready for a production build, do `npm run front_end`.

There's an editor config here to help keep consistent coding style,
indentation and before you do any commit be sure that `npm run lint`
gives no errors, or at least try to not introduce any new ones.
